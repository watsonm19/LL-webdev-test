=============================

**Please clone or fork the test from this repo**

Please markup the provided design using HTML, CSS and Javascript. A jpg of the design has been provided. Please contact us if any instruction is unclear. Thank you!

**Rules and Requirements**
+ We are interested in simplicity and your command of the front-end development languages rather than libraries and frameworks.
+ For the 3 column image section please reference the images object in app.js. Each of the images contain an image path, a heading, and description text. Use this object to build a 3-column image section at the bottom of the content area, showing images and their associated hover states.
+ Please use your judgement to make this page responsive. Simpler versions of elements on mobile is ok.
+ Please avoid using a CSS or JS framework. *Please don't require any local server setup
+ Pixel perfection is not expected. We are more interested in conveying the feel of the design.


**What We're Interested In**
+ Command of Languages
+ Best Practices
+ Intentional and Strategic Organization of Code
+ Efficiency and Cleanliness in Code
+ Browser Compatibility
+ Attention to Detail
+ Usability

**Bonus Points**
+ The use of SASS compiled down to CSS
+ The use of a build tool to automate the compilation of SASS and / or minification of JS or CSS.
+ Extra animation or small detail you can add to the design.
